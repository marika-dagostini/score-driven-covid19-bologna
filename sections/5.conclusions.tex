In this project, score-driven and state-space described in (Contreras-Espinoza et al., 2023) have been applied to daily COVID-19 data referred to the Bologna WWTP service area, from October 13, 2021, to April 4, 2023. Score-driven models with weakly seasonal components for the negative binomial distribution (SD1 and SD2) provided the most accurate forecasts compared to other models, including nonlinear state-space models with unobserved components. However, the forecasting quality was lower than the ones obtained by (Contreras-Espinoza et al., 2023) with COVID-19 data from nine Latin American countries. This suggests that while score-driven models are robust, their performance can vary depending on the dataset's characteristics and quality. In addition, the paper lacks some critical details regarding the software and libraries used, and the estimation of the model parameters, which limits the reproducibility of the analysis. Further research and more comprehensive data are needed to refine these models and improve their generalizability and reproducibility.
